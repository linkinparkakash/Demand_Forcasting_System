## OVERVIEW


Demand Forecasting SystemDemand Forecasting System

The project involved building a sales prediction model that could forecast sales for the next 3 months on a daily basis, using 4 years of historical sales data and various relevant features.
I have implemented several algorithms in our modeling process, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and XGBoost Regressor. I've trained these models on the historical sales data, testing and optimizing each model to achieve the highest level of accuracy possible, the best one was XGBoost Regressor.
To facilitate the use of the model, I've developed a Flask web app that can generate batch predictions for the 3-month period. The app was built using Python and Pandas, and it enables users to quickly and easily obtain sales forecasts based on their input data.
The goal was to create a reliable and accurate sales prediction model that businesses could use to make informed decisions that can provide valuable insights into future sales trends and assist businesses in planning and strategizing for the future.

## This is a flask app that forecasts the demand in a Batch Predicion manner and will output the results in a .csv file.
